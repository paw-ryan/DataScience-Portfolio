ANA 600: Week Two Assignment

If you have questions about the following instructions or about your
assignment, please send me an email with a description of your question
and what you’ve tried in attempt to answer it. Be sure to include your
data file and R script. Please do NOT submit late assignments; they will
not be accepted after answers are posted.

Data Description

This data was downloaded from Kaggle.com, a site that houses open source
datasets. This specific dataset is titled: “IBM HR Analytics Employee
Attrition & Performance.”

Uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore
important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home
by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by
education and attrition’. This is a fictional data set created by IBM
data scientists.

Work in R

1.  Download the Wk2\_Assign\_R\_Markdown\_Template.Rmd file (R script)
    and save it to your local computer.

2.  Download the IBM\_data.csv (data file) and save it on your local
    computer.

3.  Copy the file path of where you saved your data.

4.  Open the Rmd file with Rstudio. Read the instructions on how to
    import the data.

5.  Install and load the required packages (see R/Rstudio install
    instructions)

6.  Using what you’ve learned from the E-Textbook, write (and run\!) the
    code you would like to use to respond to the questions below. Submit
    your Rmd file containing your code and assignment answers.

Variable Distributions and Variation Report (100 points)

Write-up an APA-style report (in the R-Markdown file) summarizing the
results of your analysis, focusing on the **distributions of the
variables and variation**. Your write-up should make sense to an
external audience and be written as a standalone, APA-style report.
Write as if you are submitting a deliverable to your manager to be
presented to non-technical stakeholders. Do not expect your reader to be
familiar with the dataset, so you must introduce the purpose and scope
of your analysis. When talking about the results, refer to what the
variable means rather than how it was measured.

1.  **Purpose**: Describe three interesting hypotheses that you could
    ask with this data for *one* outcome variable. Each hypothesis
    should have one explanatory variable. Your explanatory variables
    must include one quantitative variable and one categorical variable.
    Write the relationships in word equations and give your
    interpretation for each.

2.  **Data**: Describe the characteristics (demographics) of your sample
    (see Week One Assignment). Create a categorized variable from a
    quantitative variable that describes something about your sample,
    and include it in your description. Describe the criteria you used
    to define the categories. Report descriptive statistics and
    five-number summaries of your (1) outcome and (3) explanatory
    variables. Remove outliers and describe how and why you removed
    them.

<!-- end list -->

2.  **Visualizations**: Create histograms, boxplots, jitter plots, or
    scatter plots, depending on whether they are
    quantitative/categorical and explanatory/outcome, that would best
    visualize your three hypotheses (one plot each). Use proper
    conventions and labels for your axis’s. Use smooth density overlays
    and facet grids when applicable. Be sure to use titles, axis labels,
    and legend labels if applicable.

3.  **Results**: Based on your plots and analysis of the data,
    
    1.  Describe what the bars/points, x-axis, and y-axis mean in your
        plots. Be sure to give context by referencing your variables
        (what they mean\!). Reference the figures you created in Q3 as
        you discuss them.
    
    2.  What can you say from the distributions of your variables about
        their different characteristics (e.g., shape, center, spread,
        and weirdness)?
    
    3.  What are your conclusions about the relationships between the
        outcome variable with the explanatory variables for your three
        hypotheses?
    
    4.  What can you say about the population sampled, and the
        data-generating process? Generalize your inferences from this
        sample to the intended population.

4.  **Implications**: For one of your hypotheses, give interesting
    examples that *could* result in measurement error, sampling error,
    and mistakes. What are other variables in the dataset that could
    help explain variation in your outcome? What other variables,
    **not** in the dataset, could also explain variation in the outcome?
    How so? Are there any confounding variables that may change your
    interpretations?

5.  **Discussion**: To recap, how could your analysis report be used by
    an employer? What do you believe is the practical significance of
    your analysis? Why is it important to understand the nature and
    circumstances that could influence the relationship between your
    outcome and explanatory variables?
