## Data Analysis Projects 
### R Projects
- Graduate Admissions: Exloratory data analysis to predict a student's application status for a Master's program using general linear model (GLM) and multiple linear regression (MLR). The predicted output gives students a fair idea about their chances for a particular university. 2 different analyses were conducted.
- Student Enrollment: An analysis and visualizations to predict student enrollment at National University (NU) by estimating the population mean.  
- Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic): An exploratory data analysis to predict a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass using a linear model. 
- IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition & Performance: An analysis report to uncover factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions, such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’.
- New York City Airbnb Open Data: An exploratory data analysis using regression methods on Airbnb listing activity in New York City, NY in 2019.
- Student Alcohol Consumption: An analysis report for a client to understand the leading causes of student absences in math classes. The client hypothesizes that students who are in a romantic relationship (yes or no) will tend to have more absences. An explanatory model will be used to test this research question.

### Python Projects
- United Nations Study - Fertility: 
- Berkeley Guidance Study:
- Survey of Labour and Income Dyanmics (SLID):
- Heart Disease Study: An analysis to identify trends in heart data to predict certain cardiovascular events or find any clear indications of heart health.
- Vehicle Characteristics: 428 vehicles were investigated to create a bi-variate and a multiple regression model to understand how other vehicle characteristics affect miles per gallon (MPG).
- Diamond Characteristics: A principal component analysis (PCA), Generalized Linear Model (GLM), and linear model was created. PCA reduced the dimensionality of diamond characteristics, while keeping a high percentage of explained variance. GLM and a linear model was compared to understand which model performs better. 

**Skills: Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), bi-linear regression, multiple regression, t-test, principal component analysis (PCA), Generalized Linear Model (GLM)**

### SAS Projects
- AnyState Veterans of Foreign Wars: To improve the effectiveness of AnyState's solicitation campaigns, a predictive model will be built and score their marketing database. 2 different analyses were conducted.
- Employee Voluntary Attrition: A predictive model of employee voluntary attrition was built and tested. The objective was to use a model to find current employees who might be thinking of leaving, so proactive steps can be taken to retain them. 

**Skills: SAS, ggplot .......**

## Data Audit Reports
- AnyState Veterans of Foreign Wars: A data audit report was created for AnyState Veterans of Foreign Wars. To improve the effectiveness of AnyState's solicitation campaigns, a predictive model will be built and score their marketing database. This data audit report is the first step to audit the data to support this model building effort. 
- Employee Voluntary Attrition: A data audit report was created for Fortune, Inc. The objective is to build a predictive model to find current employees who might be thinking of leaving, so proactive steps can be taken to retain them. This data audit report is the first step to audit the data to support the model.
